  Title: BeatHackerrankWithRubySelenium.rb

  Description: Simple script that uses Selenium (Ruby webdriver) to beat the first HackerRank challenge
  Notes: You need to add your login and password below before running. Make sure you've got Firefox, and you've gem-installed selenium-webdriver, then just run it with "ruby BeatHackerrankWithRubySelenium.rb'!
  Caveat: This was really a toy exercise to learn Selenium, so it's ugly as hell and won't compete with other approaches. But I had a ton of fun!
