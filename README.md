BeatHackerrankWithSeleniumWebdriver-Ruby
========================================

A simple script to beat the first HackerRank challenge using the Ruby bindings to Selenium Webdriver.

UPDATE 08/10/12: Since this script was written to beat the first challenge, and the site has since changed, you'll have to toy with it to make it work; still, I think, a neat little use of Selenium's Ruby bindings.
